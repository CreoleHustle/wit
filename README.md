# Wikipedia Image Text (WIT) Dataset

Wikipedia-based Image Text (WIT) Dataset is a large multimodal multilingual dataset.  It includes 11 million+ unique images with over 37 million sets of entity rich text descriptions  associated with these images. These images and text are from various Wikipedia pages from  over 100 languages. Its size enables WIT to be used as a pretraining dataset for  multimodal models when applied to downstream tasks such as image-text retrieval, captioning and classification. 

WIT has four main and unique advantages. 

- First, WIT is the largest multimodal dataset (at the time of writing). 

- Second, it is massively multilingual (first of its kind) with coverage over 100+ languages (each of which has at least 10K examples) and provides cross-lingual texts for many images. 

- Third, it represents a more diverse set of concepts and real world entities relative to what previous datasets cover. 

- Lastly, WIT provides a very challenging real-world test set that empirically highlights the need for learning improvements in tasks such as Retrieval and Captioning.
